## CHISEL project

### Background
Stroke is one of the leading causes of long-term disabilities, resulting in cognitive and motor impairments. Robot-mediated therapy during rehabilitation will offer highly repetitive, and high-intensity training, which will reduce manual burden on clinicians while improving motor function. Furthermore, training at home, will adhere to physical distancing measures and reduce potential exposure to Covid19 infection for vulnerable elderly population.

Due to these advantages, robot-mediated home-based therapy has gained some attention in recent years. This project is to ascertain its feasibility by placing state-of-the-art robotic-based therapy in participants' homes. The data received is from self-administered playing of exergames at home using the H-MAN, in terms of functional outputs, training duration, motivation, and user acceptance.
